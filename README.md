# cifar10-image-classification

Implemented a deep learning model using Lasagne and Theano for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The script includes data preprocessing, model architecture setup (using convolutional layers, pooling, dropout), and training configurations (epochs, batch size, learning rate). It utilizes the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. After training, the model is saved and tested on a separate test set to evaluate accuracy. The project demonstrates practical skills in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and computer vision.
